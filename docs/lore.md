## Introduction
> *"Ruan Mei possesses extraordinary perception and cognitive integration abilities, easily capturing microscopic details of reality and synthesizing them into a torrent of information within her mind."*
>
> — The IPC, about Ruan Mei

Ruan Mei is referred to by several different titles by other people: biologist, mad scientist, hermit, musician, dessert aficionado, master of creation, and many more. Some may describe her as an elegant and admirable scientist who has achieved incredible scientific feats. Others think of her as a hermit with unethical experimenting methods and a lack of empathy.

As someone who never reveals her true intentions or character, it is difficult to truly understand who Ruan Mei truly is. What are her motives? What is her true goal? Why does she act the way she does? She is a mystery, shrouded in uncertainties. Here, we take a deeper dive into Ruan Mei's character, who she really is, and possible theories surrounding her.

## About Ruan Mei
### Character
> *"My name is Ruan Mei. When saying my name, please don't run the syllables together."*

Ruan Mei is Member #81 of the Genius Society, specializing in biology and life sciences. She works alongside Herta, Screwllum, and Stephen Lloyd to create the Simulated Universe. Herta describes Ruan Mei as a "master of creation," as she specializes in developing organisms and the life sciences. This is reflected in her skill animations, hairpins, dress designs, garter, and bracelet, which are all shaped like DNA helixes.

  <figcaption>Even Ruan Mei's window is DNA-themed!</figcaption>
</figure>

Ruan Mei is described as an elegant and ambitious genius. She will do anything to study her research topic, even sacrificing basic needs for the sake of science — her Character Story II states that "She was so engrossed in her research that she never ate regularly." 

Ruan Mei is also very meticulous and thoughtful, which is reflected in her skills in embroidery, music, and even laboratory work. This is further illustrated by how Ruan Mei gifted Asta a hand-embroidered charm after Asta complimented it. In When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine, she also states "A single error in detailed research can generate issues, and I despise matters that escape my control."

While Ruan Mei is a scientist, she enjoys the arts and desserts as well. Ruan Mei loves traditional theater and opera, and she plays a ruan, a Chinese stringed instrument. She is also known to love desserts, and she can almost always be seen eating a pastry. According to one of her lines in "When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine," she enjoys the drinks of fellow Genius Society member, #55 Yu Qingtu. 

### Personality
>*"The redundancy of words and the restrictions of verbal communication make for a lot of empty noise. It makes me sad..."*

Ruan Mei is shown to be very introverted. She dislikes talking to people more than she needs to and is a solitary person. She has long since left behind her past, as well as taking on a new name. When she joined the Genius Society, she hid herself in a secret corner of the universe for her research so she could conduct it without interruptions. After receiving the gaze of Nous, it is said that she became a recluse, and that "she became even more apathetic and impassive, and even more immersed in her research."[^5] She also made sure to enter and leave the Herta Space Station quietly, avoiding all the researchers who wanted to greet her.

Ruan Mei lacks empathy and doesn't form closer relationships with anyone. According to her, "I do not have a life outside of research. People always think this price is unimaginable, but it seems rather acceptable to me."[^7] She also does not feel an attachment to the lifeforms she creates, despite them having a strong attachment to her, and does not know what to do with them most of the time. Due to her past, Ruan Mei has learned to not trust anyone, causing her to act superficially and avoid people altogether. This can also cause her to be overly cautious when dealing with others.

  <figcaption>Ruan Mei is a solitary person who enjoys being alone.</figcaption>
</figure>

>*"She is certain that she won't make another mistake. It's because she no longer trusted anyone, so she won't be let down again, and... she won't let anyone else down again."*
>
> — Ruan Mei Character Story: Part IV

Despite this, Ruan Mei is able to put up a good facade in front of others. She clearly understands what society decides is right or wrong, even if she herself does not have any moral direction. She will never say anything rude, nor does she try to make people upset, as this is not pragmatic nor conducive to any of her goals. Ruan Mei uses this understanding to her advantage by saying and doing things to please people when it benefits her.

This behavior stems from her understanding of "love." As a child, Ruan Mei understood that love came in different forms. One type of love, the one she particularly liked the most, was love by reward. When she was small, Ruan Mei preferred to do things when rewarded with her favorite snacks and desserts, and would look forward to her "rewards" after coming back from scientific expeditions. As such, her favorite type of love was her Aunt's, as she would buy little Ruan Mei snacks. This view of the world meant that she quickly realized that to get people to do what she wanted them to do, she needed to give them an incentive.

In the Simulated Universe, Ruan Mei is best known for her famous Occurrence, one that gives either all blessings of a certain Path or 2000 Cosmic Fragments (which is a large amount). With the Occurrence, it obviously becomes much easier to complete the Simulated Universe run. Getting her Occurrence usually causes most players to become excited because of rarity and because they know that it will help them immensely. Because of this, some people associate Ruan Mei with an image of generosity.

<figure markdown>

  <figcaption>Ruan Mei makes sure to reward the Trailblazer with her Occurrence.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is the incentive Ruan Mei gives to the playerbase, the Trailblazer. Her Occurrence is an example of the "reward" she gives us in order to make the Trailblazer do her bidding. This, along with Ruan Mei's sweet words and actions, gives the Trailblazer an illusion of receiving "love" from her. Even if she does not truly care for the Trailblazer, or anyone for that matter, she understands that the Trailblazer is useful to her, and she acts accordingly to gain what she needs from the Trailblazer.

Is this manipulation? Yes, it is. However, Ruan Mei does not find anything wrong about this. As long as both sides gain benefits and are satisfied, there is no problem for her. Ruan Mei rewards the Trailblazer for helping her, and if the Trailblazer isn't satisfied, she will simply offer more rewards. To Ruan Mei, that is what "love" is. She does not understand such emotions on a deeper level and herself admits that she doesn't understand "love." All she has learned is that living beings will do anything when given the proper incentives. She uses this to her advantage, noting that "Children will become more well-behaved when they see random rewards."[^1]

Ruan Mei also generally finds emotions and human sentiments, such as attachment, love, and relationships with others, an inconvenience. In her Myriad Celestia Trailer, she states that "'Attachment' involves the insular cortex, which controls anxiety and pain...The laws of "emotion" can be easily broken down." To Ruan Mei, emotions are simply unnecessary and something that hinders living beings.

<figure markdown>
  ![emotions](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/887963616182145044/1191361453807112333/ruan_mei_trailer_2.gif?ex=65a528d1&is=6592b3d1&hm=6713bf7dbe0ba4132e598b411a8ea9b128b23f40686c830e2ac87a01c3f7077d&=&width=1165&height=655)
  <figcaption>Ruan Mei believes that emotions and attachment are unnecessary.</figcaption>
</figure>

Due to her nature as a scientist who trusts only her research, Ruan Mei expresses visible dissatisfaction with the capriciousness of emotions and views attachment similarly. When her parents died, a major takeaway of hers was that "Only science... never lets anyone down"[^4]. Furthermore, when explaining to the Trailblazer why she elects to remove their memory, she states that the connection between her and the Trailblazer, an inherently complex one, will be destroyed. Ruan Mei also states that she thinks this will be more relaxing for both parties, as to her, having an emotional connection with someone is bothersome.

Ruan Mei's Character Story II also indicates that although she does not understand it, Ruan Mei does feel deeper emotion, as she expresses visible grief in the face of her parents' death. However, her form of grief is different than the typical idea one conjures when thinking of "grief." She does not cry; instead, she views the situation as a "let-down" and a chain of failed promises. She understands how she is "supposed" to feel according to society's expectations, but she does not feel that way herself. Nevertheless, their deaths catapulted Ruan Mei into a period of obsessive research, and she took their names (Ruan and Mei) as her own in tribute. 

### Research
> *"When I discovered how easy it was to cultivate a 'planet,' I began to feel... empty. I increasingly understand that I long for more fundamental research."*

Ruan Mei's research is centered on the topic of life and its "essence." She also seems to have an interest in immortality, stating that "Life is countless and varied in form...Its beauty is like a myriad of flowers, and I want to pluck the one that never wilts."[^7] 

Ruan Mei firmly believes that life, while taking on a variety of forms, is always the same at its very core. According to her, all life is simple underneath its exterior. She endeavors to find and understand this kindling of life and believes that when she does, many of the questions she has posed will be solved. If one were to trace life back to its very roots, she believes that only one equation is necessary to solve the mysteries that life has to offer. 

<figure markdown>
  ![planet](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/887963616182145044/1191355697611411577/image.png?ex=65a52374&is=6592ae74&hm=11ca156ce96ecf06abd8ca65780a1466997f374c69cf124d2be0aa830ac6d226&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1165&height=655)
  <figcaption>Ruan Mei only cares about her research: finding the origin of life.</figcaption>
</figure>

Ruan Mei is shown to neither care nor know what to do with the results of all of her experiments. This can be seen with the life forms she creates that the Trailblazer encountered, as well as her research with biology on other planets. She frequently breaks the known laws of life and leaves experimental sites with an explosion of seemingly impossible results. 

Despite this, she doesn't seem to care and views her growing reputation for her groundbreaking studies as a nuisance. Ruan Mei, unlike Herta, prefers to stay away from the limelight and dislikes any praises or publicity she receives from her research. She also views much of research as too insignificant for her: she was disappointed by how easy cultivating a planet was and longed for something more "fundamental."

After her encounter with Nous, Ruan Mei became increasingly interested in the Aeons and became even more obsessive with her research. At this point, part of her intense perseverance is to draw the eye of Nous again, as it seems to have been an incredible experience for her. Aeons (and their Emanators) fascinate Ruan Mei, and the only reason she accepted her invitation to the Genius Society was so she could research more about the Aeons in the Simulated Universe. This constant drive can also cause her to feel lost and confused at times since her experiments are coming to a standstill, as can be seen in the Trailblaze Mission before she decides to emulate an Emanator.

### Themes and Motifs
> *"Life... it always adapts to the harsh environment and grows with tenacity... Therein lies the miracle."*

Ruan Mei's overall design theme is based on plum blossoms. The character "Mei" in her name, 阮 梅, shares the same character 梅 (meaning plum) as in 梅花, or meihua, meaning plum blossom. Plum blossoms can also be seen in almost any official artwork having to do with Ruan Mei. Furthermore, Ruan Mei plays a ruan, a Chinese stringed instrument seen in her official artwork, and it is used as her weapon of choice.

<figure markdown>
  ![ult](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1106786214608109669/1174206169582161920/ruan_mei_ultimate.gif?ex=65826f36&is=656ffa36&hm=38236ed624dbfa4fb170d57c53d8eb231f36c66a1335a46064d88a5c2bd7d7c2&=&width=1165&height=655)
  <figcaption>Ruan Mei plays a ruan, and her themes are based on the meihua.</figcaption>
</figure>

While Ruan Mei's name is based on the two defining themes of her character, it also comes from her two parents' last names, which she chose to replace her original name after her parents' deaths. This is why her name is separated by a space, and why she's very particular about the space being enunciated.

In Chinese culture, plum blossoms symbolize perseverance, as they are one of the few flowers that bloom in the winter. This parallels Ruan Mei's fascination with life and its resilience to adversity, as well as the "terrifying perseverance" she displays toward her research. She was so intensive in her research that she caught the attention of Nous, the Aeon of Erudition. Plum blossoms representing the end of winter and the start of spring may also be why Ruan Mei is an ice-type character.

## Affiliations
### Genius Society
> *"You don't have to listen hard to hear the gossip coming from the Genius Society — Mad Scientist. I'll take it as a compliment."*
>
> — Ruan Mei, about the Genius Society

Initially, Ruan Mei did not want to join the Genius Society, viewing it as an interruption to her life as a recluse. She even threw away the invitation that she received from them. It was only after Herta invited her to work on the Simulated Universe, and by extension the study of Aeons, that she accepted the invitation.

  <figcaption>Ruan Mei, like the other Genius Society members, is quite aloof.</figcaption>
</figure>

After her encounter with Nous, Ruan Mei seems to have experienced a burning fascination with Aeons and an even deeper interest in "life." According to her character story IV, "Only the word 'Aeon' can stir her heart. Everything else in the universe is a mere distraction." As such, she viewed everything else about the Simulated Universe as not worth her time. She did, however, enjoy the meetings between her, Herta, Screwllum, and Stephen Lloyd. 

Ruan Mei is known to have contributed to the Simulated Universe DevLog for Lan since Herta couldn't find any records on Lan in the IPC.

### Hometown
> *"Starting from their home, a planet blessed by Abundance, they boarded research aircraft and set off to more worlds."*
>
> — Ruan Mei Character Story: Part I

Not much is known about Ruan Mei's home planet. Even Ruan Mei herself has forgotten her home after spending so much time researching. According to Ruan Mei's Character Story II, "...whenever someone asked her about her 'home,' there would be a flash of confusion in her eyes. She seems to have forgotten everything." She does not feel any connection to her roots, and she left her home behind when she was accepted into the Genius Society.

The icy planet depicted in her Myriad Celestia Trailer, "No Man's Land," may be her home. However, it is most likely not, as in the Trailblaze Mission featuring her, the Trailblazer is given the option to ask whether she has researched there before. She responds that she and her mother spent 11 polar nights there. The possibility of this being her home cannot be completely eradicated, still, as she doesn't seem to have any recollection of her home.

Ruan Mei also may be from the Xianzhou Alliance, due to her home world being blessed by the Abundance and her Chinese roots. However, this is not confirmed, either.

  <figcaption>Ruan Mei's home planet was one blessed by the Abundance.</figcaption>
</figure>

As a child, Ruan Mei explored other worlds with her mother to go on scientific expeditions. She would research other forms of life in those planets she visted, and she would try to find evidence of life in barren places such as No Man's Land. However, due to Ruan Mei leaving her home and visiting other places at such a young age, she did not feel attached to her own home world.

>*"The soft wind beckons the early spring, a joyous mood does it bring. A chill wake from rest, the plum blossom in a mess. Where is the home I miss, only remembered in drunken bliss."*

### Simulated Universe
>*"I nurture the prototypes of the universe and the Aeons."*

## Relationships

### Genius Society Members
>*"She turned to look at the letter from the Genius Society on the desk and, once again, dumped it into the trash can."*
>
> — Ruan Mei Character Story: Part III

Ruan Mei's relationship with the Genius Society is questionable at best. Of course, as the Genius Society is full of socially inept introverts, Ruan Mei also being one, she does not bother to interact with or befriend other members. Due to joining the Simulated Universe project, she was forced to socialize with Herta, Screwllum, and Stephen Lloyd, all of whom she seems indifferent about. She does slightly enjoy their meetings at times, but that is about its extent. The only other Genius Society member Ruan Mei has been known to interact with is Yu Qingtu, whom Ruan Mei is good friends with.

<div class="grid" markdown>

=== "Herta, #83"
    > *"Some may find her personality unbearable — I can understand the sentiment, but I simply don't care. Of course, Herta knows this too, so I accepted her invitation."*
    >
    > — Ruan Mei, about Herta

    Ruan Mei and Herta respect each other as colleagues. They trust each other on a work level and acknowledge the talents and achievements of the other. However, neither cares enough about the other to get closer than that. Herta is someone who is very focused on the projects she is interested in, and she will ignore everything else she deems not worth her attention. Similarly, Ruan Mei is only interested in her own research topics, and while she will do anything to advance her research, she will not try to get close to anyone she works with.

      <figcaption>Ruan Mei and Herta work together often for the Simulated Universe.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Herta and Ruan Mei regard each other as equals. When asked by the Trailblazer if Ruan Mei is a great person, Herta responds, "That's like asking 'Is Herta a great person?' The answer is obvious!" She even regards Ruan Mei as a "master of creation" and someone who is very capable, ambitious, and intelligent. While Herta may be competitive and often thinks she is the best, she does not deny that Ruan Mei's achievements are incredible. Still, she may be blunt about Ruan Mei, such as when she finds it hilarious that the IPC described Ruan Mei as "lowkey" or when she points out that Ruan Mei only accidentally saved an ecosystem because it was an unintentional byproduct of her research.
  
    >*"This is a strange, instinctive feeling. That one named 'Herta' is rather similar to me. I mean... similar on a deeper level."*
    >
    > — Ruan Mei Character Story: Part IV

    When Ruan Mei first met Herta, she felt indifferent and even annoyed by her. She only joined Herta's Simulated Universe because it would help Ruan Mei research more about Aeons. However, over time, she learned to interact more with her colleagues. Ruan Mei realized that she and Herta were both people who would ignore anything for their research, and she felt closer to Herta because of this similarity. While studying Aeons is still her top priority and her motivation to continue the Simulated Universe project, she also is willing to work with Herta.

=== "Screwllum, #76"

=== "Yu Qingtu, #55"
    > *"Yu Qingtu, Genius Society's #55, has an impressive taste in music. On account of her fantastic friendship with Ruan Mei, she once made a drink — to which she gave an eye-catching name taken from the title of her favorite ancient Amber Era music — as a gift."*
    >

    ![pinkestcollision](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/887963616182145044/1189898948530425896/latest.png?ex=659fd6c0&is=658d61c0&hm=9adb740d13430ab72ba137dc6fb0aa06a07ced957c354dd51a34fd7f3f55b433&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=384&height=384){ align=left }

    Yu Qingtu, #55 of the Genius Society, is known to be Ruan Mei's very close friend. Ruan Mei herself has stated that she enjoys her time with Yu Qingtu every time they meet, which is quite out of character for a known hermit who does not enjoy being around people.

    When discussing which member of the Genius Society should be the fifth contributor to Herta's Simulated Universe Project, Yu Qingtu was brought up. Herta noted that she was someone very dear to Ruan Mei, but she did not know if she was still alive. Ruan Mei did not confirm Yu Qingtu's status, so her whereabouts are unknown.

    Though there isn't a lot of known information about Yu Qingtu, it can easily be understood why Ruan Mei and Yu Qingtu may get along well. Both enjoy music; Ruan Mei plays the ruan and enjoys traditional opera while Yu Qingtu "has an impressive taste in music"[^8]. They both also enjoy creating food-related things. Ruan Mei loves tasting and making desserts, and Yu Qingtu is known for mixing cocktails. It can be inferred that the two enjoy the finer things in life, like the arts and fine dining.

    One of Yu Qingtu's Simulated Universe curios, The Pinkest Collision, refers to a cocktail that Yu Qingtu made for Ruan Mei. The curio increases the user's Break Effect, which works well with Ruan Mei's skills.

    It is likely that due to Ruan Mei's introverted and hermetic nature, she may not have any other friends except for Yu Qingtu.
