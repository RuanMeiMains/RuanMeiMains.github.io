## About Ruan Mei
### Character
> *"My name is Ruan Mei. When saying my name, please don't run the syllables together."*

Ruan Mei is Member #81 of the Genius Society, specializing in biology and life sciences. She works alongside Herta, Screwllum, and Stephen Lloyd to create the Simulated Universe. Herta describes Ruan Mei as a "master of creation" as she specializes in developing organisms. This is reflected in her skill animations, hairpins, dress designs, garter, and bracelet, which are all shaped like DNA helixes.

Ruan Mei is described as an elegant and ambitious genius. She will do anything to study her research topic, even sacrificing basic needs for the sake of science. Ruan Mei is also very meticulous and thoughtful, which is reflected in her skills in embroidery, music, and even laboratory work. This is further illustrated by how Ruan Mei gifted Asta a hand-embroidered charm after Asta complimented it.

While Ruan Mei is a scientist, she enjoys the arts and desserts as well. Ruan Mei loves traditional theater and opera, and she plays a ruan, a Chinese stringed instrument. She is also known to love desserts, and she can almost always be seen eating a pastry.

### Personality
>*"The redundancy of words and the restrictions of verbal communication make for a lot of empty noise. It makes me sad..."*

Ruan Mei is shown to be very introverted. She dislikes talking to people more than she needs to and is a solitary person. When Ruan Mei joined the Genius Society, she hid herself in a secret corner of the universe for her research, leaving behind her past. She also made sure to enter and leave the Herta Space Station quietly, avoiding all the researchers who wanted to greet her.

Ruan Mei lacks empathy and doesn't form closer relationships with anyone. She also does not feel an attachment to the lifeforms she creates. Due to her past, Ruan Mei has learned to not trust anyone, causing her to act superficially and avoid people altogether.

  <figcaption>Ruan Mei is a solitary person who enjoys being alone.</figcaption>
</figure>

>*"She is certain that she won't make another mistake. It's because she no longer trusted anyone, so she won't be let down again, and... she won't let anyone else down again."*
>
> — Ruan Mei Character Story: Part IV

Despite this, Ruan Mei is able to put up a good facade in front of others. She clearly understands what society decides is right or wrong, even if she herself does not have any moral direction. She will never say anything rude, and she does not try to make people upset. Ruan Mei uses this understanding to her advantage by saying and doing things to please people when it benefits her.

This behavior stems from her understanding of "love." As a child, Ruan Mei understood that love came in different forms. One type of love, the one she particularly liked the most, was love by rewarding. As a child, Ruan Mei preferred to do things when rewarded with her favorite snacks and desserts. She quickly realized that to get people to do what she wanted them to do, she needed to give them an incentive.

In the Simulated Universe, Ruan Mei is best known for her famous occurence, one that gives either all blessings of a certain path, or 2000 Cosmic Fragments (which is a large amount). With the occurence, it becomes much easier to complete the Simulated Universe run. Players become excited when they receive Ruan Mei's occurence, because they know that it will help them immensely. They then associate Ruan Mei with an image of generosity.

  <figcaption>Ruan Mei makes sure to reward the Trailblazer with her occurence.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is the incentive Ruan Mei gives to the playerbase, the Trailblazer. Her occurence is an example of the "reward" she gives us in order to make the Trailblazer do her bidding. This, along with Ruan Mei's sweet words and actions, gives the Trailblazer an illusion of receiving "love" from her. Even if she does not truly care for the Trailblazer, or anyone for that matter, she understands that the Trailblazer is useful to her, and she acts accordingly in order to gain what she needs from the Trailblazer.

Is this manipulation? Yes, it is. However, Ruan Mei does not find anything wrong about this. As long as both sides gain benefits and are satisfied, there is no problem to her. Ruan Mei rewards the Trailblazer for helping her, and if the Trailblazer isn't satisfied, she will simply offer more rewards. To Ruan Mei, that is what "love" is. She does not understand such emotions on a deeper level, and she has learned that living beings will do anything when given the proper incentives.

### Themes and Motifs
> *"Life... it always adapts to the harsh environment and grows with tenacity... Therein lies the miracle."*

Ruan Mei's overall design theme is based on plum blossoms. The character "Mei" in her name, 阮 梅, shares the same character 梅 (meaning plum) as in 梅花, or meihua, meaning plum blossom. Plum blossoms can also be seen in any official artwork having to do with Ruan Mei. Furthermore, Ruan Mei plays a ruan, a Chinese stringed instrument seen in her official artwork, and it is used as her weapon of choice.

  <figcaption>Ruan Mei plays a ruan, and her themes are based on the meihua.</figcaption>
</figure>

While Ruan Mei's name is based on the two defining themes of her character, it also comes from her two parents' last names, which she chose to replace her original name after her parents' deaths. This is why Ruan Mei's name in Chinese is separated by a space.

In Chinese culture, plum blossoms symbolize perseverance, as they are one of the few flowers that bloom in the winter. This parallels Ruan Mei's fascination with life and its resilience to adversity. It also parallels the "terrifying perseverance" she displayed toward her research, which caught the attention of Nous, the Aeon of Erudition. Plum blossoms representing the end of winter and the start of spring may also be why Ruan Mei is an ice-type character.

Ruan Mei's relationship with the Genius Society is questionable at best. Of course, as the Genius Society is full of socially inept introverts, Ruan Mei also being one, she does not bother to interact with or befriend other members. Ruan Mei only joined the Simulated Universe project to study Aeons, her primary research topic. Due to this, she was forced to socialize with Herta, Screwllum, and Stephen Lloyd, all who she seems indifferent about. The only other Genius Society member Ruan Mei has been known to interact with is Yu Qingtu, who Ruan Mei is good friends with.

<div class="grid" markdown>

=== "Herta, #83"
    > *"Some may find her personality unbearable — I can understand the sentiment, but I simply don't care. Of course, Herta knows this too, so I accepted her invitation."*
    >
    > — Ruan Mei, about Herta

=== "Screwllum, #76"
    > *"Screwllum and I have very different understandings of life, but I don't think he realizes it. Fortunately, our communication is limited to matters related to the Simulated Universe."*
    >
    > — Ruan Mei, about Screwllum

=== "Stephen Lloyd, #84"
    > *"Put a watermelon parfait in Herta's office and Stephen is sure to show up. Remember, the pumpkin ones will never attract him — those are for warding him off."*
    >
    > — Ruan Mei, about Stephen Lloyd

=== "Yu Qingtu, #55"
    > *"Yu Qingtu, Genius Society's #55, has an impressive taste in music. On account of her fantastic friendship with Ruan Mei, she once made a drink — to which she gave an eye-catching name taken from the title of her favorite ancient Amber Era music — as a gift."*
    >
    > — *The Pinkest Collision* Curio

    ![pinkestcollision](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/887963616182145044/1189898948530425896/latest.png?ex=659fd6c0&is=658d61c0&hm=9adb740d13430ab72ba137dc6fb0aa06a07ced957c354dd51a34fd7f3f55b433&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=384&height=384){ align=left }

    Yu Qingtu, #55 of the Genius Society, is known to be Ruan Mei's very close friend. Ruan Mei herself has stated that she enjoys her time with Yu Qingtu every time they meet, which is quite out of character for a known hermit who does not enjoy being around people.

    When discussing which member of the Genius Society should be the fifth contributor of Herta's Simulated Universe Project, Yu Qingtu was brought up. Herta noted that she was someone very dear to Ruan Mei, but she did not know if she was still alive. Ruan Mei did not confirm Yu Qingtu's status, so her whereabouts are unknown.

    Though there isn't a lot of known information about Yu Qingtu, it can easily be understood why Ruan Mei and Yu Qingtu may get along well. Both enjoy music; Ruan Mei plays the ruan and enjoys traditional opera while Yu Qingtu "has an impressive taste in music." They both also enjoy creating food-related things. Ruan Mei loves tasting and making desserts, and Yu Qingtu is known for mixing cocktails. It can be inferred that the two enjoy the finer things in life, like the arts and fine dining.

    One of Yu Qingtu's Simulated Universe curios, The Pinkest Collision, refers to a cocktail that Yu Qingtu made for Ruan Mei. The curio increases the user's Break Effect, which works well with Ruan Mei's skills.

    It is likely that due to Ruan Mei's introverted and hermetic nature, she may not have any other friends except for Yu Qingtu.
