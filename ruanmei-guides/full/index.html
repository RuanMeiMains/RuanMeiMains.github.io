<p>The following are the newest additions and changes to our guide with the release of patch 2.5.</p>
<h3 id="new-relic-recommendations">New Relic Recommendations</h3>
<p><img align="left" alt="ironcavalry" src="../../assets/images/guides/ironcavalry.png" width="75" /> <strong>Iron Cavalry Against the Scourge</strong> is a relic set released in 2.3 and intended for Super Break DPS characters like Firefly. While the 4PC passive doesn't benefit Ruan Mei, its 2PC passive is exactly the same as other commonly used relic sets like <strong>Thief of Shooting Meteor</strong> and <strong>Watchmaker, Dream of Machinations</strong>. In other words, this set allows for another source of Break Effect, so you can farm this set for fuel efficiency if you need <strong>The Wind-Soaring Valorous</strong> set for another character! Check out which relic sets you can use on Ruan Mei in our <a href="#4pc-relic-recommendations" title="4PC Relic Set Recommendations">4PC Relic Set Recommendations</a> section!</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="lushaka" src="../../assets/images/guides/lushaka.png" width="75" /> <strong>Lushaka, the Sunken Seas</strong>, a new planar ornament set released in 2.5, joins <strong>Sprightly Vonwacq</strong> and <strong>Penacony, Land of the Dreams</strong> as another Energy Regeneration Rate set. As Ruan Mei is heavily reliant on <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> due to her Ultimate being highly valuable, this set is already a viable alternative for her. Furthermore, its passive is less restrictive than the Penacony set and can accomodate more team compositions, making it a great option for Ruan Mei. Check out Ruan Mei's other viable planar ornaments in our <a href="#2pc-planar-ornament-recommendations" title="2PC Planar Ornament Recommendations">2PC Planar Ornament Recommendations</a> section!</p>
<h3 id="updated-synergies-and-anti-synergies">Updated Synergies and Anti-Synergies</h3>
<p><img align="left" alt="hmarch" src="../../assets/images/guides/hmarch.png" width="75" /> Following the patch 2.4 update, <strong>March 7th (Hunt)</strong> makes her debut with a new path, meant to benefit <abbr title="Follow-up Attack">FUA</abbr> and break-focused characters. March 7th deals quite a lot of Toughness damage on her own, and her Enhanced Basic Attack can pack a punch. Having Ruan Mei on her team can only benefit March's damage output. Want to learn more about Ruan Mei's best teammates and synergies? Read more about Ruan Mei's best and not-as-great teammates in our <a href="#teammates" title="Teammates Section">Teammates Section</a>.</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="lingsha" src="../../assets/images/guides/lingsha.png" width="75" /> <strong>Lingsha</strong> joins Gallagher as the second sustain character with break mechanics in patch 2.5. Like Gallagher, Lingsha's additional healing also scales off Break Effect and she aims to break enemies faster, both of which Ruan Mei benefits. Ruan Mei is the game's premier break support, so her buffs only directly benefit Lingsha's support and utility capabilities. Whether you need a second Gallagher for your break team, a <abbr title="Follow-up Attack">FUA</abbr> sustain, or just another sustain in general, make sure to pair her with Ruan Mei if you can!</p>
<p><strong>Yunli</strong>, the new Physical Destruction DPS released in patch 2.4, has been added to the list of anti-synergies with Ruan Mei. Because she is a counter-focused character like Clara, Ruan Mei's Weakness Break Extension does not synergize well with Yunli's skills.</p>
<h3 id="new-section-addition-light-cone-distribution-with-harmony-trailblazer">New Section Addition: Light Cone Distribution with Harmony Trailblazer</h3>
<p>Ever wondered who should get which light cone in your <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> and Ruan Mei Break teams? As <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> and Ruan Mei are both break-focused Harmony characters, their light cone options are very similar. In fact, Ruan Mei's signature light cone is not only <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr>'s <abbr title="Best in Slot">BiS</abbr> light cone, it even works better for <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> than Ruan Mei! Find out which light cones you should use for these two characters in our newly added <a href="#light-cone-distribution-with-harmony-trailblazer" title="Light Cone Distribution with Harmony Trailblazer">Light Cone Distribution with Harmony Trailblazer</a> section!</p>

<summary>Patch 2.3 Updates</summary>
<h2 id="guide-updates-patch-23">Guide Updates (Patch 2.3)</h2>
<p>The following are the newest additions and changes to our guide with the release of patch 2.3.</p>
<h3 id="new-character-comparisons">New Character Comparisons</h3>
<p><img align="left" alt="hmc" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/hmcf.png" width="75" /> Following the patch 2.2 story update, <strong>Harmony Trailblazer</strong> is the newest break-focused Harmony character added to the game. As the protagonist, they are free to obtain and a great budget alternative to Ruan Mei. Their unique Super Break mechanic, which was introduced along with their release, allows for characters who deal high Toughness DMG to deal high amounts of damage! How does the Trailblazer compare to Ruan Mei in break teams? Are they just a "discount Ruan Mei" for those who missed out on Ruan Mei? Or do they provide their own value to the table? Find out by checking out our updated <a href="#character-comparisons" title="Character Comparisons">Character Comparisons</a> section!</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="robin" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/robin1.png" width="75" /> <strong>Robin</strong>, Penacony's beloved singer and follower of Xipe, joins the game's roster of outstanding limited 5-star Harmony characters alongside Sparkle and Ruan Mei. Like Ruan Mei and unlike Sparkle, Robin is focused on teamwide buffs, making her a decent competitor to Ruan Mei. While Robin clearly shines the most in <abbr title="Follow-up Attack">FUA</abbr> teams, she, like the other limited 5-star Harmony characters, is a great option for general use as well. Who is the true queen of Harmony, however? Check out our updated <a href="#character-comparisons" title="Character Comparisons">Character Comparisons</a> section to find out!</p>
<h3 id="new-light-cone-flowing-nightglow">New Light Cone: Flowing Nightglow</h3>
<p><img align="left" alt="robinlc" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/flowing-nightglow.png" width="75" /> With Robin's release comes a new 5-star Harmony light cone, <strong>Flowing Nightglow</strong>. While it's obvious it is tailored for Robin, how does this light cone compare to Ruan Mei's other amazing options? Does it compare to Sparkle's or Bronya's light cones? Is it comparable to Ruan Mei's already amazing light cone options such as <abbr title="Memories of the Past">MotP</abbr> or Meshing Cogs? Find out by checking out our updated <a href="#light-cones" title="Light Cone Recommendations">Light Cone Recommendations</a> for Ruan Mei!</p>
<h3 id="updated-synergies">Updated Synergies</h3>
<p><img align="left" alt="gallagher" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/gallagher.png" width="75" /> Following the patch 2.1 update, <strong>Gallagher</strong> is introduced as the first sustain character with break mechanics, meant to benefit Nihility characters such as Acheron. His additional healing also scales off Break Effect, which Ruan Mei buffs. As Ruan Mei is the game's premier break support, her buffs only directly benefit Gallagher's support and utility capabilities. Want to learn more about Ruan Mei's best teammates and synergies? Read more about Ruan Mei's best and not-as-great teammates in our <a href="#teammates" title="Teammates Section">Teammates Section</a>.</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="hmc" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/hmcm.png" width="75" /> While <strong>Harmony Trailblazer</strong> may be seen as a direct competitor to Ruan Mei, as both characters are focused on buffing break damage characters, <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> actually works incredibly well with Ruan Mei as a teammate! Both characters provide different buffs, meaning there will be no diminishing returns in buffs, yet both effectively support break-DMG DPS characters. Ruan Mei's buffs also directly buffs <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr>'s Super Break mechanic, as Super Break depends on how much Toughness DMG a character deals and whether the enemy is Weakness Broken or not. In break-focused teams, pairing <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> and Ruan Mei together is a must.</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="boothill" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/boothill.png" width="75" /> Following the 2.2 patch update comes the game's first ever limited 5-star break-focused character. <strong>Boothill</strong>, the foul-mouthed and optimistic Galaxy Ranger, can implant Physical Weakness on enemies, allowing him to break enemies more easily. His Pocket Trickshot passive also greatly benefits from Ruan Mei's Weakness Break extension, Weakness Break efficiency increase, and Break Effect increase. This, along with Boothill's enemy action delay, is a great defensive and offensive combination for your team!</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="firefly" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/firefly.png" width="75" /> Patch 2.3 features the fan-favorite and long-awaited Stellaron Hunter, <strong>Firefly</strong>, also known as SAM. Ironically (due to their relations to the Swarm Disaster), these two characters work extremely well together. Like Boothill, Firefly can implant Fire Weakness on enemies, allowing her to break enemies more easily. Furthermore, Firefly can reduce the Toughness of enemies without Fire Weakness on her ultimate. Due to Firefly's damage being reliant on Super Break, Firefly greatly benefits from Ruan Mei's Weakness Break extension, Weakness Break efficiency increase, and Break Effect increase. As Firefly's first banner is running alongside Ruan Mei's rerun, it is necessary to try to obtain both characters if you plan to pull for Firefly. Ruan Mei is a must-have for this Stellaron Hunter!</p>

<summary>Patch 2.0 Updates</summary>
<h2 id="guide-updates-patch-20">Guide Updates (Patch 2.0)</h2>
<p>The following are the newest additions and changes to our guide with the release of patch 2.0.</p>
<h3 id="new-relic-set-watchmaker-master-of-dream-machinations">New Relic Set: Watchmaker, Master of Dream Machinations</h3>
<p><img align="left" alt="watchmaker" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/watchmaker.png" width="75" /> This new relic set not only increases Break Effect for Ruan Mei by a hefty amount, it also increases Break Effect for the entire team. Due to this new Break Effect-focused relic set, many may wonder if making the switch to this set is necessary for Ruan Mei. Find out what set is right for you by checking out our updated <a href="#4pc-relic-recommendations" title="4PC Relic Set Recommendations">4PC Relic Set Recommendations</a> for Ruan Mei!</p>
<h3 id="new-light-cone-earthly-escapade">New Light Cone: Earthly Escapade</h3>
<p><img align="left" alt="sparklelc" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/sparklelc.png" width="75" /> With the release of Sparkle, the newest and second limited Harmony character, comes a new 5-star light cone, <strong>Earthly Escapade</strong>. How does this light cone compare to other existing options? Is it better than Bronya's light cone? Maybe even Meshing Cogs? Is it worth pulling if you've missed Ruan Mei's last light cone banner? Or is it just something that only Sparkle can benefit from? Find out by checking out our updated <a href="#light-cones" title="Light Cone Recommendations">Light Cone Recommendations</a> for Ruan Mei!</p>
<h3 id="updated-synergy-and-anti-synergies">Updated Synergy and Anti-Synergies</h3>
<p><img align="left" alt="misha" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/misha.png" width="75" /> <strong>Misha</strong> joins the growing number of Ice DPS characters following the patch 2.0 update. Because of the Penacony, Land of Dreams relic set, which encourages the usage of Ice DPS characters with Ruan Mei, and his rarity, Misha is a potential budget option to use with Ruan Mei. His ultimate, which freezes enemies, pairs well with Ruan Mei's Weakness Break extension, causing enemy actions to be further delayed. With Misha's freeze and Ruan Mei's delay, enemies won't even have a chance to act! Read more about Ruan Mei's best and not-as-great teammates in our <a href="#teammates" title="Teammates Section">Teammates Section</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Seele</strong> has been added to the list of anti-synergies with Ruan Mei due to the fact that Ruan Mei can "steal" Seele's kills, preventing her from triggering her Resurgence passive. However, Ruan Mei is still a top pick for Seele due to her universal buffs.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ruan Mei is a 5-star Ice Harmony character and Member #81 of the Genius Society. As the first-ever limited 5-star Harmony character, Ruan Mei faces high expectations. These expectations especially concern her performance in relation to other high-value Harmony characters, such as Tingyun, Bronya, and Asta, as well as her overall utility and usage. Does she hold a candle to them, or is she outshined by their incredible support value? Read this guide to learn how to optimize Ruan Mei effectively, find out her best builds, and see how she can fit into your teams!</p>
<p><img alt="ruanmei" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/ruan_mei_animations.gif" /></p>
<h2 id="ruan-mei-tldr">Ruan Mei TLDR</h2>
<p class="annotate">Ruan Mei is a support character capable of increasing allies' Weakness Break Efficiency, SPD, and All-Type <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>(1). At the same time, Ruan Mei can also deal additional Break DMG whenever allies Weakness Break an enemy, causing the Weakness Broken enemies' actions to be further delayed.</p>

<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h2>
<p class="annotate">Why should you use and build Ruan Mei? Should you pull for Ruan Mei over other units? While she is admittedly high-cost for the average player as a limited 5-star character, she still provides a lot of utility as a strong support character. She certainly lives up to the daunting title of the first limited Harmony character, especially shining with her All-Type <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>, full-team buffs, and the fact that she's <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> positive(1). However, she is not an absolute must-pull, so ultimately the choice is yours to make based on your own personal needs and opinions.</p>
<ol>
<li><abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> positive, or <strong>skill point positive</strong>, refers to when a character generates more skill points than uses them. Ruan Mei is considered <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> positive because her skill, which uses one skill point, lasts for three turns. This means that two out of three of her turns will be basic attacks, generating a net positive amount of skill points for her team.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Ruan Mei's ultimate provides All-Type <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>, which is very valuable</li>
<li>Ruan Mei functions as a highly flexible team-wide support character</li>
<li>As a universal buffer, Ruan Mei will likely remain a strong character even in the future</li>
<li>Ruan Mei is <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> positive</li>
<li>Ruan Mei is super pretty!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="tabbed-block">
<p><img align="left" alt="sigh" src="../../assets/images/guides/ruan_mei_sigh.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Ruan Mei is a limited 5-star character, so she's not as easily accessible as other characters</li>
<li>Ruan Mei doesn't replace existing Harmony characters who are already considered very good</li>
<li>Ruan Mei is not a "must pull" for your account</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="playstyle-strategy">Playstyle Strategy</h2>
<p>Because Ruan Mei is <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> positive and her skill lasts for three turns, it is recommended to follow a Skill &gt; Basic &gt; Basic playstyle. Her skill should generally be used before your DPS characters take action so that your DPS can be buffed. With Ruan Mei's technique, 2pc Vonwacq, or enough SPD, this can easily be achieved. Her technique also saves one skill point at the start of battle, allowing even easier access.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to cast Ruan Mei's ultimate every three turns (this will be referred to as <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr>). This is so you can have as much ultimate uptime as possible. Ruan Mei's value mostly comes from her ultimate, so higher uptime means more buffs. The problem is that this is pretty difficult to achieve. Her signature light cone does not provide enough energy to achieve a <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr>, and Energy Recharge buffs and stats are extremely rare.</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/run3ah?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
<figure>
<figcaption>Example of a 3T ultimate with S4 <abbr title="Memories of the Past">MotP</abbr> by sealary.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Is <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr> really necessary, though? Not really, but it is ideal. It is more important to reach the minimum recommended Break Effect (180%) before focusing on a <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr>. If you're comfortable with casting Ruan Mei's ultimate every four turns instead, then that's fine! While you may lose out on some buffs, Ruan Mei certainly isn't "unplayable" with a <abbr title="4-Turn Ultimate">4T ult</abbr>. Again, it is more important to focus on having at least 180% Break Effect. </p>
<p>Still, it is best to try to optimize your ultimate uptime as much as possible. Even if you can't achieve a <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr>, you should still try to make the most of your energy and ult as much as you can with what you have. It is best to aim for <abbr title="4-Turn Ultimate">4T ult</abbr> as a minimum goal and 3T as the ideal.</p>
<p>If you are unsure if you are able to achieve a 3T or 4T ultimate with what you have, you can check our <a href="#energy-requirements" title="Ruan Mei Energy requirements">Energy Requirements</a> section in this guide!</p>

<h2 id="traces">Traces</h2>
<p>Ruan Mei's traces are mainly focused on buffing her allies, specifically around break mechanics. She relies on a high amount of break effect, and she buffs Break Effect and Weakness Break Efficiency for her allies.</p>
<h3 id="trace-priority">Trace Priority</h3>
<p><img alt="tracepriority" src="../../assets/images/guides/trace.png" /></p>
<p class="annotate">Ruan Mei's value comes from her ultimate and her skill. As a Harmony character, she focuses on buffing her allies rather than dealing high amounts of damage. Her ultimate and skill boost her allies' damage, her ultimate increases the <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>(1) of her allies, and her skill increases the overall damage and Weakness Break Efficiency of her allies. This causes these two traces to be her most valued traces and the ones that should receive the most priority.</p>
<ol>
<li><abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr> is short for <strong>resistance penetration</strong>. What is <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr> and how does it work? Check out the Trace Overview below and read more about it in her Ultimate description!</li>
</ol>
<p>Ruan Mei's ascension traces are also quite decent. Her second and fourth ascension traces are very useful in improving her support capabilities, and they should definitely be activated.</p>
<h3 id="trace-overview">Trace Overview</h3>
<div class="grid">
<div class="tabbed-set tabbed-alternate" data-tabs="2:3"><input checked="checked" id="__tabbed_2_1" name="__tabbed_2" type="radio" /><input id="__tabbed_2_2" name="__tabbed_2" type="radio" /><input id="__tabbed_2_3" name="__tabbed_2" type="radio" /><div class="tabbed-labels"><label for="__tabbed_2_1">Basic ATK: Threading Fragrance</label><label for="__tabbed_2_2">Skill: String Sings Slow Swirls</label><label for="__tabbed_2_3">Ultimate: Petals to Stream, Repose in Dream</label></div>
<div class="tabbed-content">
<div class="tabbed-block">
<h4 id="basic-atk-threading-fragrance">Basic ATK: Threading Fragrance</h4>
<p>Deals a minor amount of Ruan Mei’s ATK as ICE DMG to a single enemy. Generates 20 Energy for Ruan Mei. </p>
<p><img alt="basic" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/ruan_mei_NA.gif" /></p>
<p>This trace should be the least prioritized, as it deals very minimal damage. Furthermore, Ruan Mei relies on break effect stats rather than CRIT stats, so this trace will not be very useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="tabbed-block">
<h4 id="skill-string-sings-slow-swirls">Skill: String Sings Slow Swirls</h4>
<p>Ruan Mei gains Overtone, lasting for 3 turns and decreases in 1 usage at the start of her turn. While Overtone is active, all allies’ DMG increases and Weakness Break Efficiency increases by 50%. Generates 30 Energy for Ruan Mei. </p>
<p><img alt="skill" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/ruan_mei_skill.gif" /></p>
<p>This is one of Ruan Mei's most valuable traces. However, as mentioned above, Ruan Mei is <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> positive, meaning that she will use a Skill &gt; Basic &gt; Basic playstyle. In turn, this means that her skill does not need to be prioritized over her ultimate, which is her most important trace. Furthermore, as Ruan Mei's passives already buff her allies' DMG, leveling up her skill will lead to diminishing returns. Despite this, you'll still want to level this trace as much as possible eventually. First prioritize her ultimate, and then prioritize this trace.</p>
</div>
<div class="tabbed-block">
<h4 id="ultimate-petals-to-stream-repose-in-dream">Ultimate: Petals to Stream, Repose in Dream</h4>
<p>Ruan Mei deploys a field that lasts for 2 turns. The field's duration decreases by 1 at the start of her turn.</p>
<p>While inside the field, all allies' All-Type <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr> increases and their attacks apply Thanatoplum Rebloom to the enemies hit.</p>
<p>When these enemies attempt to recover from Weakness Break, Thanatoplum Rebloom is triggered, extending the duration of their Weakness Break, delaying their action by an amount equal to a portion of Ruan Mei's Break Effect plus 10%, and dealing Break DMG equal to a portion of Ruan Mei's Ice Break DMG.</p>
<p>Enemy targets cannot have Thanatoplum Rebloom re-applied to them until they recover from Weakness Break.</p>
<p><img alt="ult" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/ruan_mei_ultimate.gif" /></p>
<p>It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> to level Ruan Mei's ultimate. This is her bread and butter, and it is what makes her very valuable to your team. The reason why this trace should be highly prioritized is due to the All-Type <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr> that it provides, making Ruan Mei a universal shredder.</p>
<details class="tip">
<summary>What is <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr> and how does it work?</summary>
<p><abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>, short for Resistance Penetration, refers to when the character ignores the enemy's resistance. This is an incredibly useful stat, as enemy resistance affects the damage it takes quite significantly. With <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>, your damage output increases greatly, especially against enemies with high resistance.</p>
<p>For example, if an enemy has 0% Ice RES, they will take 100% of the Ice DMG inflicted on them. With 25% <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>, the enemy will now take 125% of the Ice DMG received. This means that your damage will increase by 25%.</p>
<p>If an enemy has 60% Ice RES, they will only take 40% of the Ice DMG inflicted on them. Without <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>, you will lose out on a lot of damage due to the enemy's resistance. With 25% <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>, however, the enemy's Ice RES drops from 60% to 35%. This means that the Ice DMG it receives is now 65% instead of 40%. While this doesn't look all that impressive, the DMG dealt has increased by 62.5%, which is quite a lot!</p>
<p>In conclusion, <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr> is incredibly valuable. Ruan Mei provides All-Type <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>, meaning that she is able to decrease all types of enemy resistance, making her a flexible and strong support.</p>

<p>This trace is nice to have, giving allies a free SPD boost. However, it does not increase SPD by very much, and it should not be relied on for SPD tuning, so it shouldn't be prioritized over others.</p>

<p>This trace should definitely be prioritized. When Ruan Mei's Break Effect reaches 180% or higher, her allies will recieve a free 36% DMG increase from her skill. This is also why having at least 180% Break Effect is recommended.</p>

<p><img align="left" alt="a4" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/SkillIcon_1303_SkillTree2.png" /> Ruan Mei regenerates 5 Energy at the start of her turn.</p>
<p>This trace should be prioritized. Because Ruan Mei's ultimate is important, she needs as much energy as she can get. This trace also makes <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr> possible and helps with Ruan Mei's energy management.</p>

<p>This trace is decent, but it's not as valuable as the other ascension stats. Still, it is recommended to prioritize this trace. It helps make reaching the recommended 180% Break Effect threshold easier, allowing you to invest in other stats, and it benefits any allies who need Break Effect. <strong>NOTE: THIS TRACE DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL YOU ARE IN BATTLE.</strong></p>

<p>Most players won't be pulling for eidolons, especially because Ruan Mei's base kit is already amazing, but in case you are someone who wants to know which eidolon is the best, we have you covered. If you manage to get lucky or have some extra funds, it is recommended to pull for Ruan Mei's E1. Her first eidolon is extremely powerful and offers a free DEF shred. <strong>Between E1 and signature LC, definitely pull for Ruan Mei's E1.</strong> </p>

<h2 id="light-cones">Light Cones</h2>
<p>Ruan Mei's light cone situation is quite interesting. Her signature light cone, while it is quite good due to the raw stats it offers, does not provide enough energy to achieve <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr>. This makes other budget-friendly options a viable choice for Ruan Mei, and some can even compare to or outperform Ruan Mei's signature light cone. We won't deny that Ruan Mei's light cone is extremely beautiful, though. If you are unsure of which light cone works best for your energy needs, check out our <a href="#energy-requirements" title="Ruan Mei Energy Requirements">Energy Requirements</a> section.</p>

The other benefits it provides, including high <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> positivity, are quite powerful as well, allowing it to slightly edge out S5 <abbr title="Memories of the Past">MotP</abbr>. It greatly reduces the need for Break Effect, allowing you to invest in other stats.

<td><strong>Memories of the Past</strong> is Ruan Mei's best 4-star light cone and a great budget alternative to <abbr title="Past Self in Mirror">PSiM</abbr>. It provides Ruan Mei's most needed stats, Break Effect and energy. At <strong>S3+</strong>, Ruan Mei only needs to be hit once to ensure a 3T ultimate. At <strong>S5</strong>, it competes with <abbr title="Past Self in Mirror">PSiM</abbr> because it guarantees a 3T ultimate. If you already have S5 <abbr title="Memories of the Past">MotP</abbr>, it is generally not recommended to pull for <abbr title="Past Self in Mirror">PSiM</abbr> because the difference between the two light cones is marginal. The only exceptions to this is if you plan to use <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> with Ruan Mei and don't have two S5 MotPs on hand.</td>

<td><strong>Meshing Cogs</strong>, a popular budget light cone choice for Harmony characters due to the energy it provides, is a very viable option for Ruan Mei. Because it is a 3-star light cone, it is easily accessible for F2P players. At <strong>S5</strong>, this light cone outperforms S2 <abbr title="Memories of the Past">MotP</abbr> due to the energy it provides. However, because it does not provide Break Effect, it generally performs worse than <abbr title="Past Self in Mirror">PSiM</abbr> and S5 <abbr title="Memories of the Past">MotP</abbr>. Still, if the minimum Break Effect can be achieved, this light cone is a very strong option for Ruan Mei.</td>

<td><strong>Earthly Escapade</strong> is Sparkle's signature light cone. While it doesn't provide any energy, which also means its crit buff passive only has about 50% uptime, the buffs it provides still prove useful.

<h3 id="light-cone-distribution-with-harmony-trailblazer">Light Cone Distribution with Harmony Trailblazer</h3>
<p>As break-focused teams are becoming more common, Ruan Mei will be often paired with <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr>. The problem is that both characters require high amounts of Break Effect and are both Harmony characters, meaning that given the available Harmony light cones, they will often need the same or similar light cones. Who should receive which light cone?</p>
<p>Because <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> makes better use of Ruan Mei's signature light cone than Ruan Mei does and benefits more from Break Effect rather than <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr>, it is recommended to give <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> the light cone that provides more Break Effect and Ruan Mei the light cone with more <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr>. Ruan Mei's Break Effect needs are far less than <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr>'s, but she needs much more <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr>. Below is a chart that shows who should use which light cone based on your light cone availability. If the light cone in the chart has no superimposition specified, any superimposition will suffice.</p>
<p><img alt="hmcrmlc" src="../../assets/images/hmcrmlc1.png" /></p>
<h2 id="relic-sets">Relic Sets</h2>
<p>Ruan Mei mainly needs Break Effect, SPD, and Energy Regeneration Rate, as those are the stats that help improve her support capabilities the most. Because she is a support character and Break DMG cannot crit, offensive stats such as CRIT and ATK don't contribute anything to her playstyle. Do not invest in those.</p>
<p>When choosing a relic set for Ruan Mei, prioritize reaching 180% Break Effect (160% without Ruan Mei's Inert Respiration trace) first. If you are lacking Break Effect, it may be better to run a relic set that provides more Break Effect, depending on what you need. If you are able to cast Ruan Mei's ultimate often and reach the required amount of Break Effect without a Break Effect relic set, then 4PC Hackerspace is recommended. Otherwise, consider using a 2PC 2PC alternative or even a different set.</p>
<p>For 2PC 2PC combinations, it is recommended to run a 2PC Break Effect set with 2PC Hackerspace. When choosing which Break Effect set to farm, choose the set that is more fuel-efficient. If you need the Pioneer (debuff) set, farm for Watchmaker. If you need the Boxing (physical) set, farm for Thief. If you need the Valorous (<abbr title="Follow-up Attack">FUA</abbr>) set, farm for Iron Cavalry.</p>

<p>Many players may believe that 4PC Watchmaker, the new break-focused relic set released in patch 2.0, is Ruan Mei's new <abbr title="Best in Slot">BiS</abbr> set. However, for general usage, Ruan Mei's other relic set options such as 4PC Messenger Traversing Hackerspace, 2PC Break Effect 2PC Messenger, and 4PC Thief of Shooting Meteor are better options. </p>
<p>4PC Watchmaker is definitely viable for Ruan Mei, but its 4PC passive is only useful in teams with a break-focused DPS, such as Xueyi, Sushang, Firefly, and Boothill. Otherwise, the extra Break Effect is not all that needed. Furthermore, the passive only has about a 50%-60% uptime due to Ruan Mei's ultimate duration. In teams with break-focused DPS characters, though, especially if Ruan Mei is not short on her needed stats, 4PC Watchmaker is definitely a good option to use. However, keep in mind that the 4PC effect does not stack, meaning if you are pairing Ruan Mei with <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr>, it is best to choose a different set.</p>
<h3 id="relic-stats">Relic Stats</h3>
<p><img alt="stats" src="../../assets/images/guides/statpriority.png" /></p>
<p>As mentioned before, Ruan Mei is a support character who is focused on buffing her allies. She is not meant to deal high amounts of damage. This means that it is better to focus on stats that will improve Ruan Mei's support capabilities. Defensive stats as well as supportive stats like SPD are appreciated, and as Ruan Mei scales off Break Effect, you will obviously need some Break Effect on your relics. It is very important to reach the recommended 180% (160% without Ruan Mei's Inert Respiration trace) Break Effect.</p>
<p>For Ruan Mei's chest piece and planar sphere, choose whichever relic has better substats. HP and DEF are both equally needed for Ruan Mei. For her link rope, it is better to use an <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope, as Ruan Mei requires a lot of energy to optimize her ultimate uptime. However, if you are lacking Break Effect, or if you don't have an <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope, using a BE rope for the time being is fine. Using an <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope eventually is crucial, however.</p>
<h3 id="relic-substat-priority">Relic Substat Priority</h3>
<p><img alt="statpriority" src="../../assets/images/guides/ruan_mei_trace_priority_10.png" /></p>
<p>Break Effect should be the most prioritized relic substat, as most of Ruan Mei's kit revolves around Break Effect. Ruan Mei needs at least <strong>180%</strong> Break Effect in total in order to maximize her passive. <strong>Ruan Mei's Inert Respiration trace does not take effect until you are in battle</strong>, so technically, you only need <strong>160%</strong> Break Effect. However, for the sake of consistency, the minimum will be referred as 180%. More Break Effect is generally always better as long as you're not sacrificing other stats.</p>
<p>SPD should also be prioritized, as it allows Ruan Mei to have more turns per cycle, which allows for more <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> generation due to Ruan Mei's <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> positivity. At least <strong>143</strong> SPD is recommended. Ruan Mei has a total of 134 SPD from her traces and SPD boots, so 143 SPD can be obtainable with a few substat rolls and/or 2PC Messenger Traversing Hackerspace. Like Break Effect, more SPD is better as long as you are not sacrificing other stats. Some players may opt for a slower Ruan Mei build for rare scenarios like 0 cycle runs or to keep her ultimate up for longer, but in general, more SPD is better.</p>
<p>Defensive stats such as Effect RES, HP, and DEF are also helpful for Ruan Mei. In combat, she wants to get hit a couple times in order to gain energy, meaning survivability is important to her. With some defensive stats, Ruan Mei's survivability will naturally increase. However, keep in mind that Break Effect and SPD should be prioritized over these stats.</p>
<h3 id="energy-requirements">Energy Requirements</h3>
<p>Ruan Mei requires as much energy as she can, as her ultimate is extremely valuable for her team. As mentioned before, it is ideal to cast a 3T ultimate for as much uptime as possible. However, 3T ultimate is difficult to achieve, so a 4T ultimate is fine as well if you are lacking in Break Effect. Below are some energy and light cone combinations to determine if you can achieve a 3T or 4T ultimate with Ruan Mei.</p>
<p>A special case is if you have Huohuo on your team. Huohuo will lower your rotation by one turn.</p>
<p>Note that to achieve 124.4% ER, you must use an <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope and Penacony/Vonwacq/Lushaka. To achieve 119.4% ER, you must use an <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope. To achieve 105% ER, you must use Penacony/Vonwacq/Lushaka.</p>

<p>Due to her universal buffs, such as SPD increase, DMG% increase, and All-Type <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr> decrease on enemies, Ruan Mei can fit in most teams and can effectively support most DPS characters. If you're wondering if Ruan Mei can work well with your main DPS, the answer is yes if they're not Clara. Even characters who don't benefit as much from Break Effect still benefit form Ruan Mei due to her strong buffs. Below are some characters who work particularly well with Ruan Mei.</p>

<td><img alt="asta" src="../../assets/images/guides/asta.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Asta</strong> is a great budget option to use with Ruan Mei. She naturally has incredible toughness damage, so she can break very often, which goes well with Ruan Mei's kit. Fire characters also have a high break multiplier, so a higher break effect allows for more break damage. Furthermore, both Asta and Ruan Mei buff speed, so you will be able to have several turns before the enemy does. Another great thing about Asta is that she buffs ATK% while Ruan Mei buffs DMG%, which allows for less diminishing returns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="sw" src="../../assets/images/guides/sw.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Silver Wolf</strong> is a teammate who will pair well with Ruan Mei. Her main gimmick revolves around weakness implant, and Ruan Mei is focused around teams who will break the enemy. Silver Wolf guarantees that your team will be able to break the enemy and use Ruan Mei to her full potential. Also, Silver Wolf's DEF shred is valuable, and she deals a decent amount of toughness break damage herself. She especially shines with Ruan Mei when using a break effect-focused build.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="xueyi" src="../../assets/images/guides/xueyi.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Xueyi</strong> gains a DMG boost based on her Break Effect, a stat that Ruan Mei increases for her allies. Furthermore, Xueyi's ultimate deals Toughness DMG regardless of their weakness element, which allows for easier breaking of the enemy. Xueyi is also a 4-star character, making her more accessible for F2P players.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="sushang" src="../../assets/images/guides/sushi.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Sushang</strong> benefits from Break Effect, and she benefits greatly from enemies being weakness broken, making her a great option to go with Ruan Mei. Additionally, Sushang has high Weakness Break Efficiency, which allows her to break often. Physical characters also have a high break multiplier, so a higher break effect allows for more break damage. Furthermore, Sushang is a 4-star character, which means she is more accessible for F2P players.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="kafka" src="../../assets/images/guides/kafka.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Kafka</strong> works extremely well with Ruan Mei. This is because Ruan Mei's buffs, such as <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr> and DMG%, affect <abbr title="Damage Over Time">DoT</abbr>, and <abbr title="Damage Over Time">DoT</abbr> still occurs while enemies are weakness broken. Furthermore, breaking enemies also triggers <abbr title="Damage Over Time">DoT</abbr>, and Ruan Mei allows her allies to break more often.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="welt" src="../../assets/images/guides/welt.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Welt</strong> deals 20% more DMG to enemies inflicted with Weakness Break, making him a great option to pair with Ruan Mei. He also slows enemies, which is a great utility to have and one that synergizes quite well with Ruan Mei. Ruan Mei's Weakness Break and SPD buffs paired with Welt's Slow debuffs make a great team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="misha" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/misha.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Misha</strong> is a new 4-star Ice DPS character for patch 2.0. He benefits from the Penacony, Land of Dreams relic set on Ruan Mei as an Ice DMG dealer. Furthermore, due to his rarity, he is considered a budget option who is more accessible for F2P players. While he doesn't exactly benefit from Ruan Mei's Break Effect buffs, his ultimate, which can freeze enemies, can help further delay enemy actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="gallagher" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/gallagher.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Gallagher</strong> was introduced as the first break-focused Abundance character for patch 2.1. His kit allows enemies to receive more break DMG, and allies receive additional healing based on his Break Effect. With Ruan Mei on the team, who increases Break Effect and Weakness Break Efficiency, Gallagher's support capabilities are enhanced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="hmc" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/hmcf.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Harmony Trailblazer</strong> is a new free Harmony character for patch 2.2, as part of the Trailblazer's newest path switch. They work hand in hand with Ruan Mei as a powerful support duo for break-focused DPS characters. Ruan Mei's Weakness Break efficiency buff, Weakness Break extension, and Break Effect boost pairs especially well with <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr>'s Toughness Reduction buff, Break Effect boost, and Super Break. Their buffs don't have much overlap, which means they don't suffer from diminishing returns. When using a break-focused DPS character, using both <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> and Ruan Mei is a must.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="boothill" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/boothill.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Boothill</strong> is the first limited 5-star character who is focused on break mechanics, released in patch 2.2. His Pocket Trickshot benefits from enemies being Weakness Broken, and Boothill deals additional damage based on his Toughness damage, meaning that Ruan Mei is a great teammate for him. Boothill also implants Physical Weakness during his ultimate, allowing him to make better use of Ruan Mei's break-focused buffs. Physical characters also have a high break multiplier, so a higher break effect allows for more break damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="firefly" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/firefly.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Firefly</strong> is the second break-focused limited 5-star character, releasing in patch 2.3 alongside Ruan Mei's first rerun. Her damage is reliant on Break and Super Break mechanics, and she also can implant Fire Weakness and reduce the Toughness of enemies without Fire Weakness. As Firefly greatly benefits from enemies being Weakness Broken, Ruan Mei's Weakness Break efficiency buffs, Weakness Break extension, and Break Effect boost are very much needed buffs for Firefly. While these two characters may not get along lore-wise, they are inseparable teammates in combat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="hmarch" src="../../assets/images/guides/hmarch.png" /></td>
<td><strong>March 7th (Hunt)</strong> makes her path switch debut in patch 2.4. In her new swordswoman-in-training form, she takes on the role as a sub-DPS whose main source of damage comes from her Enhanced Basic Attack. March 7th can be built as either a crit-focused or break-focused sub-DPS, as she can deal high amounts of Toughness damage (even being able to reduce Toughness bars that have the same weakness as her Shifu) as well as raw damage from her <abbr title="Enhanced Basic Attack">EBA</abbr>. With Ruan Mei on her team (not as her Shifu, though!), March's damage output and Toughness reduction capabilities are greatly enhanced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="lingsha" src="../../assets/images/guides/lingsha.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Lingsha</strong> is the second break-focused healer, released in patch 2.5. As a Fire Abundance character who is focused on break mechanics, Lingsha will often draw comparisons to Gallagher. However, she has her own unique mechanics as well, such as <abbr title="Follow-up Attack">FUA</abbr>, frequent teamwide cleanse, and decent sub-DPS damage. She also allows for more Break DMG upon using her ultimate, which pairs well with Ruan Mei. As a character who benefits from Break Effect and deals decent Toughness damage on her own, Lingsha makes great use of Ruan Mei's buffs and is a great addition to Super Break teams. Outside of break teams, Lingsha can also act as an alternative to Aventurine due to her being a <abbr title="Follow-up Attack">FUA</abbr> sustain.</td>

<h3 id="notable-anti-synergies">Notable Anti-Synergies</h3>
<p>Below are some characters who don't synergize as well with Ruan Mei. However, these characters (except Clara and Yunli) can still be used with Ruan Mei, and Ruan Mei can still be a top teammate pick for them. They will just need a little more consideration when being used with Ruan Mei. The only characters who truly do not work with Ruan Mei are Clara and Yunli.</p>

<tr>
<td><img alt="clara" src="../../assets/images/guides/clara.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Clara</strong> is one character who absolutely won't work with Ruan Mei. Clara relies on getting hit in order to counter enemies, but Ruan Mei helps keep enemies weakness broken. If enemies are broken, then Clara can't get hit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="yunli" src="../../assets/images/guides/yunli.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Yunli</strong> doesn't work with Ruan Mei for the same reasons Clara doesn't work with Ruan Mei. To maximize her damage output, Yunli relies on getting hit to counter enemies, which means that she does not want enemies to stay weakness broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="himeko" src="../../assets/images/guides/himeko.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Himeko</strong> isn't the most anti-synergistic with Ruan Mei due to the fact that she wants to break as many enemies as possible. However, Ruan Mei also extends Weakness Break (her "second break" from her Thanatoplum Rebloom does not add any stacks for Himeko), which means that it will take longer for Himeko to gain stacks and trigger her follow-up attack. She can still be used with Ruan Mei because she benefits from Weakness Break buffs, but she will have a harder time gaining stacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="seele" src="../../assets/images/guides/seele.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Seele</strong> is also in a similar boat as Himeko. She isn't the most anti-synergistic with Ruan Mei, and she greatly benefits from her buffs, making Ruan Mei a top pick for Seele. However, Ruan Mei's Thanatoplum Rebloom from her ultimate can accidentally "steal" Seele's kills, preventing Seele from triggering her Resurgence passive. This can be worked around, but it needs to be considered when using Ruan Mei and Seele together.</td>

<p>Below are some example team compositions for Ruan Mei. These are not the only team compositions that can be used with Ruan Mei; as mentioned before, she is an incredibly flexible unit. Rather, these teams are some notable examples to provide a general idea of how to use Ruan Mei in various team compositions. For team slots that specify a position rather than a specific character, any character who fits that role would work.</p>

<h2 id="character-comparisons">Character Comparisons</h2>
<p>Ruan Mei may be the first limited 5-star Harmony character, but she isn't the only Harmony or support character in the game. There are many other great characters to use, and many may wonder how she may compare to those characters.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img alt="bronya" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/bronya.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Bronya</strong> was the only other 5-star Harmony character Ruan Mei could compare to during her release, and as a Harmony character, she is focused on buffing her allies' DMG. However, that is where their similarities end. Bronya is focused on single-target buffs, while Ruan Mei buffs the entire team at once. Furthermore, Bronya's kit revolves around increasing ATK% and CRIT DMG, whereas Ruan Mei's kit focuses on increasing Weakness Break Efficiency, Break Effect, and SPD. Because they are so different, it is better to consider what you need and which DPS character you are using. As a standard character, however, Bronya is easier to obtain than Ruan Mei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="tingyun" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/tingyun.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Tingyun</strong> is generally regarded as one of the best characters in the game due to how versatile and universal she is as a support. It's even better that she's a 4* character, making her very accessible for F2P players. Tingyun's ultimate, which restores energy for allies, is also something extremely useful. However, again, as Ruan Mei and Tingyun do different things, you should use whoever benefits your team more. You can even use both characters together. Tingyun buffs ATK% while Ruan Mei buffs DMG%, which reduces diminishing returns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="asta" src="../../assets/images/guides/asta.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Asta</strong> is a popular Harmony option for many players due to her being completely free to obtain. Despite being a budget-friendly character, Asta provides a lot of value due to her ATK% buffs and her huge flat SPD boost from her ultimate. While Ruan Mei and Asta may seem similar due to the fact that they both provide buffs and increase SPD, they are quite different. Ruan Mei buffs DMG%, while Asta buffs ATK%. This makes Asta someone who runs very well with Ruan Mei, rather than someone to be replaced by Ruan Mei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="pela" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/pela.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Pela</strong> is a Nihility character, while Ruan Mei is a Harmony character. However, as both are Ice supports, they may be compared quite often, especially for Ice DMG-focused teams. Because Ruan Mei and Pela are both different characters who provide different things, it is again recommended to run them together if possible. However, if you must choose one or the other, choose whoever benefits your DPS more. Ruan Mei buffs Break Effect and Weakness Break Efficiency, which might be more valuable to certain characters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="yukong" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/yukong.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Yukong</strong> is also a free-to-obtain character, making her another popular Harmony choice for players. However, without E6, Yukong's buff window is very small. Ruan Mei's buff window is much longer, making her a very comfortable choice for players. Yukong also buffs ATK% and CRIT while Ruan Mei buffs DMG%, so it is possible to run them together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="hmc" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/hmcm.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Harmony Trailblazer</strong>, a free character introduced in patch 2.2, can be seen as a "discount Ruan Mei" of sorts at first glance, as both are Harmony characters who focus on break-related buffs. However, they both provide something unique to the table. Along with Ruan Mei's generic teamwide buffs, such as <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr> and DMG increase, Ruan Mei also provides Weakness Break extension and prolonged Weakness Break efficiency buffs. <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr>'s main gimmick is their Super Break, a new mechanic following their release. Because the two characters both benefit break-focused characters but provide different buffs, it is better to run the two together. When using a break-focused DPS character, it is strongly recommended to run <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> and Ruan Mei in the team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img alt="robin" src="../../assets/images/guides/full/robin1.png" /></td>
<td><strong>Robin</strong> joins Ruan Mei and Sparkle as the third limited 5-star Harmony character following patch 2.2. While every limited Harmony character shines in their specific specialty (Ruan Mei for break, Sparkle for hypercarry, and Robin for <abbr title="Follow-up Attack">FUA</abbr>), they are all great for general-use as well. Sparkle is mainly hypercarry-focused due to her single-target buffs, but Robin and Ruan Mei both provide teamwide buffs. Obviously, Ruan Mei is the better option for break-related teams, while Robin is the better option for <abbr title="Follow-up Attack">FUA</abbr> teams. For <abbr title="Damage Over Time">DoT</abbr> comps, Ruan Mei still surpasses Robin despite Ruan Mei's Weakness Break extension and Robin's teamwide advance being similarly beneficial for <abbr title="Damage Over Time">DoT</abbr>, mainly because of Ruan Mei's <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>. For hypercarry, Robin allows for a higher damage ceiling at the cost of more <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr>. Ruan Mei is much more <abbr title="Skill Point">SP</abbr> friendly than Robin, though Robin's hypercarry buffs are stronger than Ruan Mei's due to her crit buffs. Still, what's better than one amazing Harmony character? Two amazing Harmony characters! It never hurts to expand your support roster, and you will always need multiple strong units for endgame modes that require multiple teams, such as MOC and PF.</td>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>If you didn't read through this guide thoroughly, you probably don't know the answers to these commonly asked questions, but don't worry. If you just skipped to the end to find the answers to these questions, we've got you covered.</p>
<h3 id="e1-or-signature-light-cone">E1 or Signature Light Cone?</h3>
<p>Ruan Mei's <strong>E1</strong> is highly recommended over her light cone. There are a couple great alternatives to Ruan Mei's signature light cone, and at high superimpositions, they may even outperform Ruan Mei's light cone. This is because Ruan Mei's light cone does not provide enough energy to ensure a <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr>, and the Break Effect it gives at S1 is comparable to the amount of Break Effect S5 Memories of the Past gives.</p>
<p>Conversely, Ruan Mei's E1 is incredibly valuable. As her best eidolon, it ignores 20% DEF during Ruan Mei's ultimate. This is basically like having 4PC Genius of Brilliant Stars, which is a popular relic set for even non-Quantum DPS characters. That's how good DEF shred is.</p>
<h3 id="err-or-be-rope"><abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> or BE rope?</h3>
<p>It is recommended to run an <strong><abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope</strong> over a BE rope. Ruan Mei's ultimate is very valuable and provides All-Type <abbr title="Resistance Penetration">RES PEN</abbr>, a very helpful buff. Energy Regeneration is also not easily obtained, as it cannot be gained via relic substats. The only relic with an Energy Regeneration main stat is the link rope, so that is the only Energy Regeneration you can possibly obtain via relics.</p>
<p>Break Effect, on the other hand, can be obtained via relic substats, relic passives, and Ruan Mei's traces. It is not difficult to reach the recommended 180% without a BE rope.</p>
<p>Because Ruan Mei's ultimate is so powerful, it is highly recommended to have as much Energy Regeneration as possible. This is why <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope is recommended over BE rope.</p>
<h3 id="is-4pc-watchmaker-master-of-dream-machinations-ruan-meis-new-bis-set">Is 4PC Watchmaker, Master of Dream Machinations Ruan Mei's new <abbr title="Best in Slot">BiS</abbr> set?</h3>
<p>The short answer is: no, 4PC Watchmaker is not Ruan Mei's <abbr title="Best in Slot">BiS</abbr>. For general usage, Ruan Mei's other relic set options such as 4PC Messenger Traversing Hackerspace, 2PC Break Effect 2PC Messenger, and 4PC Thief of Shooting Meteor are better options. 4PC Watchmaker is definitely viable, but its 4PC passive is only useful in teams with a break-focused DPS, such as Xueyi, Sushang, Firefly, and Boothill. Otherwise, the extra Break Effect is not all that needed. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the passive only has about a 50%-60% uptime due to Ruan Mei's ultimate duration, and the 4PC passive does not stack, meaning only one ally can use this set. Since <abbr title="Harmony Trailblazer">HMC</abbr> will usually be the one using this set, and they'll often be paired with Ruan Mei, Ruan Mei has no need to use this set.</p>
<h3 id="is-3t-ult-really-necessary">Is 3T Ult Really Necessary?</h3>
<p>While a <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr> is optimal, it's not necessary. It is better to focus on achieving the minimum amount of Break Effect (180%) before focusing on achieving a <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr>. However, even if you cannot achieve a <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr>, still aim for as high ultimate uptime as possible. Ruan Mei's ultimate is very valuable, so the more you can cast your ultimate, the better.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-break-effect-can-i-sacrifice-for-3t-ult">How much Break Effect can I sacrifice for 3T Ult?</h3>
<p>It is recommended to first aim for 180% Break Effect, then to focus on <abbr title="3-Turn Ultimate">3T ult</abbr>. If you have less than <strong>170%</strong> Break Effect, it is better to settle for a <abbr title="4-Turn Ultimate">4T ult</abbr> instead, as losing out on the recommended Break Effect negatively affects Ruan Mei more than having less ultimate uptime. However, it is not recommended to settle for anything more than a <abbr title="4-Turn Ultimate">4T ult</abbr>. A 5T ult is not recommended, and using an <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope is still recommended over a Break Effect rope. You can see what combination of light cones and <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> works best for you in our <a href="#energy-requirements" title="Ruan Mei Energy Requirements">Energy Requirements</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-break-effect-is-too-much">How much Break Effect is too much?</h3>
<p>While the recommended minimum Break Effect is 180%, you can definitely have more Break Effect. There is no limit to how much Break Effect to have, but you should not be sacrificing other stats for Break Effect. Once you hit 180% Break Effect, focus on other stats; if you have extra Break Effect to spare even after hitting the recommended stats, that's perfectly fine.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-run-a-break-effect-rope">Can I run a Break Effect rope?</h3>
<p>In all situations, a Break Effect rope should only be used if you do not have an <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope. This goes for when you cannot reach 180% Break Effect as well. Even with other energy sources, having an <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope is still recommended. It is generally more beneficial for your team to cast Ruan Mei's ultimate more often, and an <abbr title="Energy Regeneration Rate">ERR</abbr> rope is the largest source of energy for any character. Sacrificing over 19% energy for more Break Effect, which is a stat that can be obtained via relic substats, is not worth it. The only exception for this is if you are willing to <abbr title="4-Turn Ultimate">4T ult</abbr> with S5 Meshing Cogs.</p>
<h2 id="closing-final-thoughts">Closing &amp; Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>In conclusion, Ruan Mei is a strong buffer who can fit in any team. She is future-proof and will remain a strong unit even in later patches. She is slightly costly, and she isn't meant to replace other Harmony units, but she shines in her own way. Also, it gives players a chance to invest in a stat that wasn't commonly invested in before.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to our Theorycrafting Team for their work in creating this guide! From working on calculations to answering questions, their contributions have been invaluable.</p>
<p>This guide will be updated as future content updates and changes Ruan Mei's recommended playstyle. Thanks for reading, and we hope you found this guide helpful!</p>
